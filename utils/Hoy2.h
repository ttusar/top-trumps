/// HOY algorithm
/**
 * This class contains the implementation of the HOY (Hypervolume by Overmars and Yapp) algorithm for the computation of the hypervolume indicator.
 * It is a minor adaptation of the refactoring of the original code, which was done with minor improvements and optimizations.
 * Original source code of HOY by Nicola Beume can be found here: http://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/beume/publications/hoy.cpp
 *
 * Krzysztof Nowak proposed some improvements and modified the code to reuse the available methods where possible:
 *  - Computation of trellis is optimized so it doesn't use the inclusion-exclusion approach but works in O(d) time instead
 *  - Some data types were altered to fit pagmo conventions
 *  - Reusability of some common methods
 *  - Making it work for the negative values of the objectives
 *  - Optimization for memory allocation
 *
 * @see Nicola Beume and Guenter Rudolph, "Faster S-Metric Calculation by Considering Dominated Hypervolume as Klee's Measure Problem.",
 * In: B. Kovalerchuk (ed.): Proceedings of the Second IASTED Conference on Computational Intelligence (CI 2006), pp. 231-236.  ACTA Press: Anaheim, 2006.
